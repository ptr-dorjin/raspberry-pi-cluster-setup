= Raspberry Pi Network Setup

NOTE: This step is based on how Jeff Geerling sets up network for his Raspberry Pi "Dramble" cluster

- cd to `./03-set-up-network`
- In `inventory`, list all Raspberry Pi's _current_ IP addresses (automatically assigned)
- In `vars.yml`, specify each Pi's MAC addresses and desired final IP addresses and hostnames. MAC addresses can be found by running `sudo nmap -sP 192.168.0.1/24` (use your subnet range)
- Run `ansible-playbook -i inventory main.yml`
- Reboot Pis: `ansible all -i inventory -m shell -a "sleep 1s; shutdown -r now" -b -B 60 -P 0`
